## Setup an Umbraco Project

With as many tasks as I can, I'm going to mark a time next to them so I can see roughly how much time I've spent on projects. 

- Setup Umbraco Project in folder (10mins)

`dotnet new umbraco -n DashboardProject` 

10 mins due to installing latest template to get newest version of Umbraco and then reminding myself on the command for installing a new project.
