- Install Umbraco 11
- Install Dot Net 7
- Remove old project file - forgot I had actually created it! 
- Install Contentment

## Install Nvm / Node / UI Library

- Went to https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/install?v=true and then went to https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows and downloaded nvm-setup.exe from https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases

- Once that was downloaded and installed, I ran `nvm install latest` followed by `nvm use 19.3.0` in Terminal
- Then ran `npm install` while in this project, not sure if that actually worked so then ran `npm i @umbraco-ui/uui` to install the Umbraco UI library in to the project. 
- I didn't expect this to work however, I created a quick dashboard in the backoffice and added `<uui-button><uui-badge slot="extra" label="A11Y label">!</uui-badge>I can have badge</uui-button>` and just like that, a button appeared in the backoffice! 
- I did check the `package.json` file and I could see that a dependency had been added, I just thought I might need more than that. 

```
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@umbraco-ui/uui": "^1.0.2"
  }
}
```
