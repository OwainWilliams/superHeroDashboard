- Initial setup of this repo
- Add a readme file
- Get the source file and save it in this project
- Reference original repo where this csv was taken from


### Initial thought process

- Going to need a migration plan for creating a custom database table. 
  - This is going to need to match the mapping of the CSV headings
  - Make a migration model which is literally used for the migration plan
- Once the migration works, make an API Controller or maybe a service or both? Which order? Needs some thought
-
