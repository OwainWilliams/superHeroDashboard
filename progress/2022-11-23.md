- Initial setup of this repo
- Add a readme file
- Get the source file and save it in this project
- Reference original repo where this csv was taken from


### Initial thought process
- Install a clean version of Umbraco
- Database Migration (more details below)
- Create a dashboard that firstly, uploads the CSV file to disk
  - Once the file has been uploaded to disk, then run an import on that file
  - Things to check
    - check that the upload destination exists, if it doesnt then make the folder.
    - Check that the file being uploaded is a CSV
    - that the file is a csv âœ…
    - Use CSVHelper package - this needs installed in the project

### Database Migration thoughts
- Going to need a migration plan for creating a custom database table. 
- This is going to need to match the mapping of the CSV headings
- Make a migration model which is literally used for the migration plan
