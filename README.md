# Super Hero Dashboard
A project for building a Super Hero Dashboard in Umbraco

## What is this? 
I've been challenged by [Nik](https://github.com/NikRimington) to build a custom dashboard in Umbraco which imports a CSV for superheros. 

Over time, I'm sure this will grow but I'm using this repo to document my progress and maybe us my notes as a blog in future. 

## What's the source file? 

The source is from [this repo](https://github.com/nosql-bootcamp/marvel-heroes/blob/master/scripts/all-heroes.csv)

## How will you keep up to date with progress?

My plan is to create individual diary entries so I can look back and see how I went about things. My thought process etc. All entries will be saved in the Progress folder in the repo.
